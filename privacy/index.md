## 1. Overview and scope

This Policy applies to personal information processed when you use Mealizer AI on iOS and Android. It covers information you provide, information generated by the app (including AI-generated meal plans), and limited technical information needed to operate the service.

**Not medical advice.** Mealizer AI is a lifestyle and planning tool. It does not provide medical diagnosis, treatment, or clinical dietary advice. If you have a medical condition or allergies requiring professional guidance, consult a qualified healthcare professional.

---

## 2. Eligibility and children's privacy

Mealizer AI is intended for users **18 years of age or older**. We do not knowingly allow use by or collect personal information from individuals under 18.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe a user under 18 has provided personal information, please contact us. We will take steps to delete the information.

---

## 3. Accounts and identifiers (no login)

Mealizer AI does not require traditional account sign-in (no email/Apple/Google login). Instead, we generate a **random unique identifier** for your app installation to store your profile and meal plans on our servers.

Because we do not use email-based accounts, your data is primarily managed through in-app controls (edit profile, disable notifications, delete account/data).

---

## 4. Personal information we collect

We collect only the information needed to provide the app, generate meal plans, and manage subscriptions and notifications.

### 4.1 Information you provide (profile and preferences)

You may provide the following profile information:

- Name and surname; gender; age  
- Height; weight; goal (lose/maintain/gain); optional target weight  
- Diet type; allergies; disliked foods  
- Daily activity level  
- Time available for cooking; meals per day; meal budget; cooking skill level  
- Water intake frequency and related lifestyle preferences  

**Health-related information.** Some profile fields (for example weight and allergy information) may be considered sensitive or health-related under certain laws. We collect and use this information only to generate meal plans and provide app functionality.

### 4.2 Third-party AI processing (Google Gemini) - detailed

Mealizer AI uses a third-party AI service (**Google Gemini**) to generate meal plans. This section describes how the AI feature works and what data is involved.

**When AI processing happens**  
AI processing occurs when you actively use AI features, including (a) generating a meal plan and (b) chatting with AI to revise or refine an existing plan or meal. For example, you may ask the AI to swap ingredients, adjust portions, regenerate a day, or tailor meals based on your preferences.

**What data is sent to Google Gemini**  
We send the information needed to fulfill your request, which may include:

- Diet type, goals, and daily activity level  
- Allergies and disliked foods (to avoid unsafe ingredients)  
- Height, weight, age (to tailor portions and nutritional direction)  
- Meals per day, cooking time constraints, budget, and cooking skill level  
- Water intake preference and other lifestyle preferences you provided  
- If you entered name or gender, these fields may also be included in the profile data sent for personalization (they are not required to generate a plan).  
- Your AI chat messages and instructions (what you type in the chat).  
- Relevant context from your existing meal plan/meal (for example selected meals, ingredients, and steps) that is necessary to fulfill your request.  

**What data is NOT sent to the AI provider**

- Your push notification token  
- Your in-app purchase payment details (Apple/Google process payments)  
- Photos, contacts, or precise location (we do not collect these)  

**What we receive back**  
We receive AI-generated content (e.g., meal plans, revised meal suggestions, ingredient substitutions, updated steps, and chat responses).

**How we store AI-related data**  
We store your profile information and the resulting meal plan (including revisions) in our database so you can view it later. We do **not** store your AI chat messages or chat history; after a chat-based revision, we store only the updated plan/meal content.

**AI provider retention and human review**  
Google states that for abuse monitoring, it retains prompts, contextual information, and generated outputs for **55 days**. If content is flagged by safety filters, authorized Google employees may review the flagged prompts or outputs. Google also states that data retained for abuse monitoring is used solely for policy enforcement and is not used to train or fine-tune models.

**We use paid AI services for end-user requests**  
We use paid AI services for processing end-user meal plan requests and do not intentionally send sensitive, confidential, or unnecessary information beyond what is required to generate your plan.

**AI outputs may be inaccurate**  
AI-generated meal plans can contain mistakes. Do not rely on Mealizer AI for medical, allergy, or safety-critical decisions. Always verify ingredients and consult a professional when needed.

**Your explicit permission for third-party AI**  
Before we share personal information with a third-party AI provider, we will clearly disclose this in the app and ask for your explicit permission. If you do not grant permission, you may not be able to use AI meal plan generation features.

### 4.3 Push notification data

If you enable notifications, we store a **push token** (for example an Expo Push Token) to deliver push notifications. You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings.

### 4.4 Subscription and paywall data (in-app purchases)

We offer subscriptions through in-app purchases on the Apple App Store and Google Play. Payment is processed by Apple or Google. We do not receive or store your full payment card details.

We may store limited purchase information needed to validate entitlements:

- Subscription status (active/inactive)  
- Purchase and receipt identifiers as needed to confirm access to paid features  

### 4.5 App diagnostics and internal logs

We maintain a simple internal logging system for reliability and security. These logs may include:

- A timestamp, event type (for example onboarding completed), and app version  
- Error messages or crash-like diagnostics (when something fails)  
- The random unique identifier for your app installation (to associate logs with your data)  

We do not use these logs for advertising or cross-app tracking. We do not run third-party analytics SDKs.

---

## 5. Information we do not collect

- Photos or media uploads (we do not provide photo storage).  
- Precise location data.  
- Advertising identifiers or data used for cross-context behavioral advertising.  
- Third-party analytics SDK data (for example Amplitude, Firebase Analytics).  

---

## 6. How we use personal information

We use personal information for the following purposes:

- To provide core functionality (store your profile and meal plans).  
- To generate meal plans using AI, based on your profile inputs.  
- To manage subscriptions and validate paid access (paywall).  
- To send push notifications if you opt in.  
- To operate, secure, and improve the app (minimal diagnostics and internal logs).  

---

## 7. Legal bases (EEA/UK users)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we process personal data under one or more legal bases depending on the feature:

- Performance of a contract: to provide the functionality you request, including AI meal plan generation.  
- Legitimate interests: to keep the service secure and functional (minimal diagnostics and logs).  
- Consent: for push notifications and for explicit permission before sharing personal data with third-party AI providers.  
- Explicit consent (where required): for processing health-related or sensitive profile information (e.g., weight and allergy information) to generate meal plans.  

---

## 8. Sharing and disclosure

We share personal information only as needed to operate the app:

- Backend and database hosting: Convex (EU region).  
- AI generation: Google Gemini (third-party AI provider).  
- Push notification delivery: Expo push services and platform notification services (Apple APNs / Google FCM).  
- Subscriptions: Apple and Google process payments; we receive limited purchase data to validate entitlements.  
- Legal compliance: we may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.  

Apple, Google, and other platform providers may process information independently under their own privacy policies when you download or purchase apps through their stores.

---

## 9. International data transfers

We host our backend in the EU. However, some service providers (such as AI and push notification infrastructure, and app stores) may process data outside your country. Where required for EEA/UK users, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers.

---

## 10. Data retention and deletion

### 10.1 Retention

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy:

- Profile data and meal plans: kept until you delete your account/data in the app.  
- Push token: kept while notifications are enabled; deleted when disabled or when you delete your account/data.  
- Subscription/entitlement records: kept while needed to validate access and handle subscription-related issues.  
- Server logs and backups: may be retained for up to 90 days for security and troubleshooting, then deleted or overwritten.  

### 10.2 Deletion (hard delete)

You can delete your account/data from within the app. We will delete your profile, meal plans, push token, and related records from primary storage. Some data may remain temporarily in backups/logs for up to 90 days.

---

## 11. Security

We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect personal information, including limiting access to internal logs to the administrator. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data using appropriate safeguards.

---

## 12. Your rights and choices

Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, objection or restriction, and data portability.

To exercise your rights, contact us at **mgsncktr@gmail.com**. Because we do not use traditional accounts, we may ask for information needed to locate your data. In-app deletion is the fastest way to remove your data from our systems.

You can manage notifications in your device settings at any time.

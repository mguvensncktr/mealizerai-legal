## 4. Relationship to Apple and Google store terms

If you download the App from the Apple App Store or Google Play, your use is also subject to the applicable store terms and policies.

For iOS users: Apple may apply its standard end-user license agreement (EULA) unless a custom EULA is provided. Apple is not responsible for the App's content and is not a party to these Terms, except to the extent it is a third-party beneficiary where applicable.

Store terms may govern payments, refunds, and device usage rules. If these Terms conflict with mandatory store rules, the mandatory store rules control.

## 7. AI Features (Google Gemini)

### 7.1 When AI is used
AI processing happens when you actively use AI Features, including:
- Generating a meal plan, and
- Chatting with AI to revise or refine an existing plan or meal (for example swapping ingredients, adjusting portions, regenerating a day, or tailoring meals).

### 7.2 What you may submit to AI
When using AI Features, you may submit User Input such as profile information, preferences, and your instructions/messages. You must ensure your User Input is accurate and that you have the right to provide it.

**Do not submit**:
- Personal data of other people,
- Confidential information you do not have the right to share,
- Anything illegal, abusive, or that violates others' rights.

### 7.3 How AI data is handled (no chat history stored by us)
We do **not** store your AI chat messages or chat history in our database. After a chat-based revision, we store only the **updated plan/meal content** so you can view the result later.

However, your prompts/messages and related context are transmitted to the third-party AI provider (Google Gemini). The AI provider may retain and process that data under its own policies (including abuse monitoring). This is described in our Privacy Policy.

### 7.4 AI output limitations
AI outputs are generated automatically and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable. You are responsible for how you use AI outputs. We do not guarantee that AI outputs will be correct, safe, or appropriate for any specific purpose.

### 9.2 Auto-renewal and cancellation
Subscriptions typically auto-renew unless cancelled. You can manage and cancel subscriptions through your Apple or Google account settings.

### 9.3 Pricing and taxes
Prices, billing periods, and taxes may vary by country/region and are shown in the store at the time of purchase.

### 9.4 Refunds
Refund requests are handled by Apple or Google under their refund policies. We cannot issue refunds for purchases processed by the stores unless the store permits it.

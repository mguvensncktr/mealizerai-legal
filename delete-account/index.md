# Delete Account & Data Erasure — Mealizer AI: Meal Planner
**Effective date:** February 3, 2026  
**Last updated:** February 3, 2026

This page explains how to delete your account/data in Mealizer AI: Meal Planner and what happens when you do.

> **Important note about accounts:** Mealizer AI does not use traditional sign-in (no email/Apple/Google login). Your data is associated with a random unique identifier generated for your app installation. “Account” on this page refers to the data linked to that identifier.

---

## 1) Where to delete your account (in the app)
You can delete your account/data directly inside the app:

**Profile → Account → “Delete My Account”**

When you tap the button:
1. You will see a **clear warning** stating that your data will be deleted.
2. If you **confirm**, we begin the deletion process.

---

## 2) What gets deleted
When you confirm account deletion, we perform a **hard delete** from our primary databases for the data associated with your app installation identifier, including:

### 2.1 Profile & preferences
- Name / surname (if provided)
- Gender, age
- Height, weight, goal (lose/maintain/gain), optional target weight
- Diet type, allergies, disliked foods
- Activity level, cooking time constraints, budget, cooking skill
- Meals per day and other lifestyle preferences you entered

### 2.2 Meal plans & AI-generated outputs stored by the app
- Meal plans generated for you
- Any revisions or updates to your plans/meals created by the AI features (we store the updated plan/meal so you can view it later)

### 2.3 Push notification token (if enabled)
- If you enabled notifications, we store a push token to deliver notifications. This token is deleted when you delete your account/data.

### 2.4 App-installation identifier and associated records
- Records linked to your random unique app installation identifier are removed from primary storage when deletion is confirmed.

---

## 3) What does *not* get deleted (or is outside our control)
### 3.1 App Store / Google Play subscription history
If you purchased a subscription via Apple App Store or Google Play:
- **Payments and subscription management are handled by Apple/Google.**
- Deleting your account in Mealizer AI **does not cancel** your subscription.
- You must cancel your subscription in your device’s subscription settings (App Store / Google Play).

We may store limited purchase/receipt identifiers needed to validate paid access while your subscription is active. After you delete your account/data, any purchase history still exists with Apple/Google under their policies.

### 3.2 Copies that may remain temporarily in backups/logs
Even after a hard delete from primary storage, some data may remain **temporarily** in:
- **Server logs and backups** used for security and troubleshooting

These are retained only for a limited period and then deleted or overwritten (see Section 4).

### 3.3 Third-party AI provider retention (Google Gemini)
When you use AI features, your prompts/context and generated outputs are processed by the AI provider. The AI provider may retain prompts/context/outputs for a limited period for abuse monitoring. This retention is governed by the provider’s policies.

---

## 4) How long deletion takes
### 4.1 Primary deletion
Once you confirm deletion inside the app, we delete your profile, meal plans, push token, and related records from **primary storage**.

### 4.2 Backups and logs
Some data may remain in backups/logs for a limited time (for example, up to **90 days**) and is then deleted or overwritten as part of normal maintenance.

### 4.3 AI provider retention window
The AI provider may retain prompts/context/outputs for a limited period (for example, **55 days**) for abuse monitoring and policy enforcement, as described in our Privacy Policy.

---

## 5) What if you delete the app (uninstall) without deleting your account?
Uninstalling the app **does not automatically delete** server-side data.

Because your data is associated with an app installation identifier, uninstalling/reinstalling may create a new identifier and you may lose the ability to delete the previous installation’s data from inside the app.

**Best practice:**  
Before uninstalling, use **Profile → Account → Delete My Account**.

---

## 6) If you can’t access the app but want your data deleted
If you no longer have access to the app/device, you can email us to request deletion.

Because we do not use traditional accounts, we may ask for information needed to locate your data (for example: approximate meal plan creation date/time, device/platform, subscription status, or other non-sensitive details that help us find the correct installation record).
